# two arduino Serial Communications

IT is the serial communication protocol used by Arduino to communicate with microcontrollers and PCs. Arduino has one UART port at D0 and D1. A serial bus with two terminals is used in UART communication, one for sending data named Tx at pin D1 and another one for receiving data which is denoted as Rx at pin D0. So, all the devices that works over UART protocol must have two serial pins:
